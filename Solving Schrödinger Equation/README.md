# Solving the Schrödinger Equation: Numerical and Analytical Methods

## Project Overview
This project explores both analytical and numerical solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation, a fundamental component of quantum mechanics. We specifically focus on a particle in a potential step, which is a common scenario in quantum physics studies. The goal is to understand the quantum behaviour of particles under various potential scenarios using a combination of mathematical techniques.

## Background
The Schrödinger equation is essential for describing how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. This project uses the time-independent form of the equation, which is crucial for exploring stationary states.

## Methods
The project employs:
- **Analytical Methods:** Used for simpler potential functions where explicit solutions can be derived.
- **Numerical Methods:** The finite difference method is used to solve the Schrödinger equation numerically, which is beneficial for complex potential scenarios where analytical solutions are not feasible.

## Features
- **Potential Step Analysis:** Analysis of quantum behaviour in potential step scenarios.
- **Wavefunction Visualization:** Plotting of wavefunctions for different energy levels to visually assess the quantum states.
- **Eigenvalue Problems:** Calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for different Hamiltonian matrices constructed from potential scenarios.
