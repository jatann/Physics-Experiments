# Physics-Experiments

### Project Overview
This project focuses on determining the oscillation parameters of neutrinos using a simulated neutrino oscillation experiment. Neutrinos, subatomic particles that interact only via weak interaction and gravity, exhibit a quantum mechanical phenomenon known as neutrino oscillations due to differences in their interaction and matter eigenstates.

### Objective
The main objective of the project is to measure neutrino oscillation parameters using simulated experiments. Specifically, the tasks involve:
1. Determining the shape of the neutrino beam in energy using measurements from a near detector.
2. Predicting the measurement at a far detector given different possible neutrino oscillation parameters.
3. Fitting the far detector neutrino spectrum to find the best fit oscillation parameters.

### Methodology
- **Simulation**: The project uses a two-neutrino flavour approximation to simulate the survival probability of muon neutrinos.
- **Analysis**: You've performed data analysis and parameter estimation using Python with libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib for numerical operations and data visualization.

### Technical Details
- **Equations Used**: The muon neutrino survival probability is modeled using specific parameters like the neutrino travel length, energy, mass squared differences between neutrino mass eigenstates, and a mixing angle.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to use simulated data to study fundamental properties of neutrinos, enhancing our understanding of their mass and the quantum mechanical nature of their oscillations.
